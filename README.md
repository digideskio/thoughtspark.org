### Overview
This project contains the [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com) sources to generate
[ThoughtSpark.org](http://www.thoughtspark.org) and the generated resources so that
[GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) can serve things properly.  If you'd like to provide feedback about the site
itself or to request migrating one of the old articles to the new site, use the project
[issue tracker](https://github.com/whitlockjc/thoughtspark.org/issues) or hit me up on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/whitlockjc).

### Important Paths
* [source](https://github.com/whitlockjc/thoughtspark.org/tree/master/source) - This is where all of the resources for
the site are used by [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com) to generate the site
* [.tm_properties](https://github.com/whitlockjc/thoughtspark.org/blob/master/.tm_properties) - This is my
[TextMate](https://github.com/textmate/textmate) configuration
* [CNAME](https://github.com/whitlockjc/thoughtspark.org/blob/master/CNAME) - This is used by 
[GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) to allow for [thoughtspark.org](http://thoughtspark.org) to be served
* [config.rb](https://github.com/whitlockjc/thoughtspark.org/blob/master/config.rg) - This is the
[Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com) configuration file
* [Gemfile](https://github.com/whitlockjc/thoughtspark.org/blob/master/Gemfile) - This is a file used by the Ruby gem
bundler
* [Gemfile.lock](https://github.com/whitlockjc/thoughtspark.org/blob/master/Gemfile.lock) - This is a file used by the
Ruby gem bundler
* [README.md](https://github.com/whitlockjc/thoughtspark.org/blob/master/README.md) - This is file used by GitHub to
render the project landing page

Everything else in the project root is generated by [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com).  I'll document more of the
important paths within the source directory as time permits.
