  <p>Whenever we feel cheated as a customer, it&rsquo;s our first reaction to tell the world about it.  Leaving a bad online
review, lashing out on social media, posting the experience online for the world to see&hellip;it&rsquo;s become the norm.  Heck,
there is a current news story titled: <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/scathing-yelp-review-cost-woman-750k/story?id=22260611">Scathing Yelp Review Could Cost Woman $750K</a>.  What about
when things go right?  Where is the &ldquo;Amazing Yelp Review Could Earn Woman $750K&rdquo;?  While that will likely never happen,
I do think we should be more equal in dishing out our online opinions.  Don&rsquo;t only shout to the masses when things go
wrong, do the same when things go right.  And that&rsquo;s my plan for this post, I want to tell you of a recent interaction
with <a href="http://www.brooksrunning.com/">Brooks Running</a>.</p>

<p>I started running back in 2010 but I didn&rsquo;t really hit my stride until last year.  At the end of 2012, I bought a pair
of Brooks Pure Connect running shoes.  I bought them because they looked great and they were lightweight.  Over the
next year, I wore the soles off of these shoes.  They lasted over 300 miles of actual running distance, a
<a href="http://toughmudder.com/">Tough Mudder</a>, two <a href="http://mudbrigadenoco.com/">Mud Brigade</a> races, a <a href="http://paulstofko.com/Crazy_Legs_5k.php">Crazy Legs 10K</a> and countless
runs.  These shoes were amazing, best pair of shoes I&rsquo;ve ever owned.</p>

<p>When it came time to replace them, the Brooks Pure Connect 2 had just come out and I expected the same from them
but I couldn&rsquo;t find a pair that fit right.  So I went to the internet and found that <a href="http://www.6pm.com/">6pm.com</a> had a few
different pair of the original Brooks Pure Connect shoes, new in the box.  Sure, they were a year model old but
I had proven these shoes were what I wanted.  I bought three pair.  I wanted to make sure I had the shoes I wanted for
as long as I could.  So I started running in them, spreading the load between the three pair to ensure they&rsquo;d last me
as long as possible.</p>

<p>One day I finished a 4 mile run and I noticed one shoe was a little looser than the other.  After looking into it, I
noticed the elastic tongue strap on one shoe was hanging by a thread.  This shoe only had 20 miles on it.  The other
two pair had the same mileage on them and looked out of the box new.  This is weird so I reach out to Brooks
Customer Support.</p>

<p>When you reach out to Brooks Customer Support, they ask you to describe the shoe, the age, the mileage and to include
a picture of the defect.  I filled out their form, submitted and waited.  My initial response from them could be
summarized like this: Your shoe is the original Brooks Pure Connect, we just released the Brooks Pure Connect 3 so
the best we can do is offer you 25% off your next purchase.  This is a reasonable response but the shoe was only
4 months old and only had 20 miles on them and I really felt this was a defective shoe because of the nature of the
tear.</p>

<p>I responded back but when I did, I made sure to be as tactful as possible.  I told them I was disappointed because the
shoe was defective, not something that can manifest by sitting in a box on a shelf I added, and that I was stuck with
a shoe I couldn&rsquo;t wear, a shoe that other than this issue looked out of the box new.  The next response I got back was
a breath of fresh air.  They basically said that my <strong>respectful</strong> response was appreciated and that they had decided
that they would honor the warranty from purchase, something they surely didn&rsquo;t have to do, and send me a new pair of
the Brooks Pure Connect 3 shoes.</p>

<p>I was blown away.  I didn&rsquo;t expect this after they had already said there wasn&rsquo;t anything they could do beyond their
standing offer in the previous email.  I figured my email would be skimmed and put into some virtual folder.  In the
end, I was wrong and Brooks went above and beyond.  The way they treated me has created a Brooks customer for life.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I cannot guarantee this will be your outcome in a similar set of circumstances, nor should you consider this
to be the norm.  This story is to showcase an awesome example of customer service.</p>
