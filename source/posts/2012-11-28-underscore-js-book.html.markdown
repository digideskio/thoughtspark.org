Let's make it official, in case you didn't hear on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/whitlockjc/status/259296818360377346),
I've signed a contract with [O'Reilly Media](http://oreilly.com/) to write a book about
[Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org).  How did I get into this awesome situation you might ask?  Well, back in
October [Jeremy Ashkenas](https://twitter.com/jashkenas) posted
[on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jashkenas/status/258249389733187584) saying that if you were interested in writing
a book about Underscore.js, let him know.  I submitted my proposal and it was accepted.  **WOOHOO!!!**  Needless to
say, I'm very excited about this opportunity and I'll do my best to make sure this thing happens.

### Any Suggestions?
I don't just want my name on the cover of just any book, I want this book to be the best possible.  That being said,
while I already have some ideas of my own, I'd love to hear anything you think that could help me the book awesome.  To
do that, leave your requests/suggestions in the comments.

### Progress
I've already started work on this book based on the proposal sent to O'Reilly.  As I make progress, I'll keep you guys
up to speed here on ThoughtSpark.org.  Feel free to reach out to [me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/whitlockjc) or
in the comments with anything pertinent to this effort.
