I was going through my [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader) stream today when I came across a thread that
bothered me: [Borderlands 2’s Writer Says He’ll Change Tiny Tina If She Conveys Racism, As Some Players Think](http://kotaku.com/5981171/players-accuse-tiny-tina-from-borderlands-2-of-verbal-blackface-gearbox-writer-says-hell-change-her-if-racist).
After reading the thread, I was shocked at the accusation myself.  I remember playing [Borderlands 2](http://www.borderlands2.com/)
with a good friend of mine a few days after the release and not only enjoying the Tiny Tina character but laughing so
hard I was crying.  I love Tiny Tina and I just cannot see how she or the person behind her
([Anthony Burch](https://twitter.com/reverendanthony)), could be considered racist.  I would had left it at a simple
reply to Anthony on Twitter supporting him and [Gearbox Software](http://www.gearboxsoftware.com/) but feeling that
there is so much more to this than 140 characters can say, I figured I'd weigh in here.

### What is Racism?

Racism, as defined by [Merriam-Webster](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/racism), is as follows:

> Any action, practice, or belief that reflects the racial worldview—the ideology that humans are divided into separate
> and exclusive biological entities called _races_, that there is a causal link between inherited physical traits and
> traits of personality, intellect, morality, and other cultural behavioral features, and that some _races_ are innately
> superior to others.

That being said, where in the descriptoin above  does it say that someone of one race using the *lingo* of another
race is racism, or that a race could even impose ownership of *lingo*?  The idea of saying that Tiny Tina's character
is racist because she uses *"black lingo"* is a joke, although not a laughing matter because it's ridiculous
accusations like this that fuel the controversal matters of racism.  Could you imagine calling
[Eminem](http://www.eminem.com/), one of the most talented rappers ever to grace a microphone, a racist because he's
white and uses *"black lingo"* in his raps?

### My Opinion

In my personal opinion, I think the idea of suggesting that *lingo* could be owned by a race could be considered racist.
I mean, suggesting that people of a certain race are the only ones to use certain words is a race-based stereotype, much
like what is described above.  Having grown up in Georgia myself, I knew quite a few white girls/guys that used
*black lingo* and black girls/guys that used *white lingo*.  To us, they were just words.  As long as you stayed away
from the derogatory words/phrases commonly referred to as *racial slurs*, you used whatever verbiage best fit who you
were with and the context of the conversation regardless of which race used the verbiage most or coined a particular
word/phrase.

What did Gearbox say about the matter?  Here is Gearbox President Randy Pitchford's
[response on Twitter](https://twitter.com/duvalmagic/status/297897719148716032):

> [@reverendanthony](https://twitter.com/reverendanthony) tina is not racist because you are not racist. You're a pillar
> of tolerance and inclusion.

### In Conclusion

Borderlands 2 is an awesome game and Tiny Tina is one of my favorite game characters of all times.  Like many others, I
find her hilarious and did not even think of the race card while enjoying the parts of the game she was in.  I think
Anthony did an excellent job making Tiny Tina quirky, unique and memorable, all the things you'd want from a gaming
character.  I also applaud his handling of the situation linked to above.  In the end, I wish him the best and I hope
that people can stop trying to make something out of nothing, the world is already destructive enough without outlandish
accusations about very sensitive subjects such as racism.
