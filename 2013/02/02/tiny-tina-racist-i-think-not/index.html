<div class="article-content">
  <p>I was going through my <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a> stream today when I came across a thread that
bothered me: <a href="http://kotaku.com/5981171/players-accuse-tiny-tina-from-borderlands-2-of-verbal-blackface-gearbox-writer-says-hell-change-her-if-racist">Borderlands 2’s Writer Says He’ll Change Tiny Tina If She Conveys Racism, As Some Players Think</a>.
After reading the thread, I was shocked at the accusation myself.  I remember playing <a href="http://www.borderlands2.com/">Borderlands 2</a>
with a good friend of mine a few days after the release and not only enjoying the Tiny Tina character but laughing so
hard I was crying.  I love Tiny Tina and I just cannot see how she or the person behind her
(<a href="https://twitter.com/reverendanthony">Anthony Burch</a>), could be considered racist.  I would had left it at a simple
reply to Anthony on Twitter supporting him and <a href="http://www.gearboxsoftware.com/">Gearbox Software</a> but feeling that
there is so much more to this than 140 characters can say, I figured I&rsquo;d weigh in here.</p>

<h3>What is Racism?</h3>

<p>Racism, as defined by <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/racism">Merriam-Webster</a>, is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Any action, practice, or belief that reflects the racial worldview—the ideology that humans are divided into separate
and exclusive biological entities called <em>races</em>, that there is a causal link between inherited physical traits and
traits of personality, intellect, morality, and other cultural behavioral features, and that some <em>races</em> are innately
superior to others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That being said, where in the description above  does it say that someone of one race using the <em>lingo</em> of another
race is racism, or that a race could even impose ownership of <em>lingo</em>?  The idea of saying that Tiny Tina&rsquo;s character
is racist because she uses <em>&ldquo;black lingo&rdquo;</em> is a joke, although not a laughing matter because it&rsquo;s ridiculous
accusations like this that fuel the controversal matters of racism.  Could you imagine calling
<a href="http://www.eminem.com/">Eminem</a>, one of the most talented rappers ever to grace a microphone, a racist because he&rsquo;s
white and uses <em>&ldquo;black lingo&rdquo;</em> in his raps?</p>

<h3>My Opinion</h3>

<p>In my personal opinion, I think the idea of suggesting that <em>lingo</em> could be owned by a race could be considered racist.
I mean, suggesting that people of a certain race are the only ones to use certain words is a race-based stereotype, much
like what is described above.  Having grown up in Georgia myself, I knew quite a few white girls/guys that used
<em>black lingo</em> and black girls/guys that used <em>white lingo</em>.  To us, they were just words.  As long as you stayed away
from the derogatory words/phrases commonly referred to as <em>racial slurs</em>, you used whatever verbiage best fit who you
were with and the context of the conversation regardless of which race used the verbiage most or coined a particular
word/phrase.</p>

<p>What did Gearbox say about the matter?  Here is Gearbox President Randy Pitchford&rsquo;s
<a href="https://twitter.com/duvalmagic/status/297897719148716032">response on Twitter</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/reverendanthony">@reverendanthony</a> tina is not racist because you are not racist. You&rsquo;re a pillar
of tolerance and inclusion.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>In Conclusion</h3>

<p>Borderlands 2 is an awesome game and Tiny Tina is one of my favorite game characters of all times.  Like many others, I
find her hilarious and did not even think of the race card while enjoying the parts of the game she was in.  I think
Anthony did an excellent job making Tiny Tina quirky, unique and memorable, all the things you&rsquo;d want from a gaming
character.  I also applaud his handling of the situation linked to above.  In the end, I wish him the best and I hope
that people can stop trying to make something out of nothing, the world is already destructive enough without outlandish
accusations about very sensitive subjects such as racism.</p>
